# Examples
Here are some examples programs. They can be run with `co aot <file> -o <output>` or `co jit <file>`. For programs that need libc, the command must include `-l c`
The programs are:
- `functions.co`- demonstrates use of functions
- `helloworld.co`- prints "Hello, World!"
- `print-fn.co`- implements a print function using printf but escaping `%` characters
- `variables.co`- demonstrates use of variables
